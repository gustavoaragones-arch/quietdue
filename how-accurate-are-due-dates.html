      <h1>How Accurate Are Early Due Date Calculations?</h1>
      <p>If you&rsquo;ve used a calculator to estimate a due date, you might wonder how reliable that number is. The short answer: it&rsquo;s an estimate, not a guarantee. Here&rsquo;s what that means and why early estimates are often shown as ranges.</p>

      <h2>LMP method explanation</h2>
      <p>Most early due date calculations use the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP). A common rule adds 280 days (40 weeks) to that date. The method assumes a typical cycle length (around 28 days) and ovulation around the middle of the cycle. This is the same approach used by many healthcare providers when you don&rsquo;t yet have ultrasound data.</p>
      <p>In practice, cycles vary. Ovulation can occur earlier or later. The exact moment of conception is rarely known. So the &ldquo;due date&rdquo; you get is best understood as the center of a range—a useful reference point, but not a precise prediction.</p>

      <h2>Why ultrasounds adjust dates</h2>
      <p>An early ultrasound measures the developing pregnancy and can provide a different gestational age. When that measurement differs significantly from the LMP-based date, many providers will adjust the due date. That doesn&rsquo;t mean the original estimate was wrong. It means early dating has natural limits, and ultrasound adds information.</p>
      <p>Some providers stick with the LMP date if it&rsquo;s consistent with the scan. Others prefer the ultrasound date when there&rsquo;s a discrepancy. Practices vary. What matters is that your provider uses a consistent date for your care.</p>

      <h2>Natural variation</h2>
      <p>Several factors affect how accurate an early due date is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cycle regularity.</strong> Regular cycles make LMP-based dating more reliable. Irregular cycles introduce more uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Ovulation timing.</strong> The standard rule assumes ovulation around cycle day 14. If you ovulate earlier or later, the estimate may be off.</li>
        <li><strong>Recall.</strong> The first day of full flow (not spotting) is what matters. Approximate dates are often used when the exact day isn&rsquo;t clear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These variations are normal. They&rsquo;re why due dates are treated as estimates, not certainties.</p>

      <h2>Why early estimates are ranges</h2>
      <p>Because of this variation, many calculators and providers use a confidence window: the due date plus or minus several days (often around ±10 to ±14 days). That range reflects real variation in how pregnancy develops and when ovulation occurred.</p>
      <p>Treating the result as a range helps set realistic expectations. It avoids planning around a single day that may shift. When you have your first appointment, your provider can discuss which date to use and whether an early ultrasound would be helpful.</p>

      <h2>What happens at the first appointment</h2>
      <p>Many providers will confirm your LMP-based estimate and may schedule an early ultrasound. That scan can measure the developing pregnancy and assign a gestational age. If that measurement differs from the LMP date by more than a certain margin (often five to seven days in the first trimester), some providers will adjust the due date. Others may stick with the LMP date if it&rsquo;s consistent with the scan. Practice patterns vary by provider and region.</p>
      <p>Having an estimate beforehand can help you prepare. You&rsquo;ll know roughly what to expect. You can bring questions about how the date was calculated and whether an adjustment might be needed. Your provider can explain their approach and why they use a particular date for your care.</p>

      <h2>Setting realistic expectations</h2>
      <p>Early due dates are useful as a starting point. They give you a reference frame and help you orient yourself in the first weeks. They are not, however, a promise of precision. A difference of a week or more between an LMP-based estimate and an ultrasound-based date is not unusual. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything went wrong. It reflects the limits of early dating and the natural variation in how cycles and pregnancy develop.</p>
      <p>If you find yourself anxious about the numbers, it can help to remember that due dates are tools for planning and coordination, not guarantees. Your provider will use the best information available at each stage. The estimate you get from a calculator is one piece of that picture—valuable, but not final.</p>

      <h2>Using a calculator wisely</h2>
      <p>Early pregnancy calculators are most helpful when you understand their limits. They use the same LMP-based rule that many providers use. They can give you an estimate quickly and privately. They can help you prepare for conversations with your care team. What they cannot do is replace medical advice, account for your specific medical history, or predict exactly when your baby will arrive. Use the tool as one input among many, and always bring questions to your provider.</p>
      <p>Use the result as a range, not a fixed date. Plan around a window of several days. When you have your first appointment, bring your estimate and any questions. Your provider can confirm, adjust, or refine the date based on their assessment and any imaging that&rsquo;s performed. Many people find that having a preliminary estimate reduces anxiety and helps them feel more prepared for the conversation.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Early due dates are estimates based on the last menstrual period and standard assumptions about cycle length and ovulation. They are useful but imprecise. Ultrasounds may later provide a different date. Treating the result as a range rather than a single day helps set realistic expectations. A calculator can give you a starting point; your provider will help refine it as more information becomes available. The goal is to give you orientation and context, not to pretend that early dating is more precise than it is.</p>
