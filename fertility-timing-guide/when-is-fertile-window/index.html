      <h1>When Is the Fertile Window?</h1>
      <p class="last-reviewed">Last reviewed: February 2026</p>

      <p>The fertile window is the span of days in a menstrual cycle when conception is biologically more likely. It typically includes the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation. When that window falls on the calendar depends on when you ovulate, which varies by person and from cycle to cycle. There is no single calendar answer; estimation tools use your cycle length and last period to suggest when your window might be.</p>

      <h2>How the Window Relates to Ovulation</h2>
      <p>Ovulation is the release of an egg. Sperm can survive for several days, so the days before ovulation are part of the fertile window. The window is usually described as about six days in total—the five days before ovulation and the day of ovulation. After the egg is released, it is viable for a short time; the window is often considered to end around the day of ovulation or shortly after, depending on the source. This is a general pattern, not a rule that applies identically to everyone.</p>

      <h2>Why the Date Changes Each Cycle</h2>
      <p>Ovulation timing can shift from month to month. So the fertile window does not fall on the same calendar dates every cycle. A 28-day cycle might have ovulation around day 14; a 32-day cycle might have it around day 18. Stress, travel, and natural variation can move ovulation earlier or later. Calculators estimate based on your average cycle length; they cannot detect these shifts. Treat the result as an estimated window, not a fixed schedule.</p>

      <h2>How Estimation Tools Place the Window</h2>
      <p>Fertility window calculators take your last period date and average cycle length, estimate when your next period is likely, then count backward to estimate ovulation. They then show the fertile window around that date. The result is an approximation. If your cycle or ovulation is different that month, the actual window may not match. Use the tool for orientation; it does not replace methods that detect ovulation or advice from a healthcare provider.</p>
