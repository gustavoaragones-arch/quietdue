      <h1>What Is a Regular Cycle?</h1>
      <p class="last-reviewed">Last reviewed: February 2026</p>

      <p>A regular cycle is one where the length from the first day of one period to the day before the next tends to be fairly consistent from month to month. For example, cycles might usually fall in a narrow range, such as 27 to 30 days. Regular does not mean exactly the same number of days every time; small variation is normal. Irregular cycles are those where the length varies more widely from cycle to cycle.</p>

      <h2>How Cycle Length Is Measured</h2>
      <p>Cycle length is the number of days from the first day of menstrual bleeding to the day before the next period starts. So a 28-day cycle means 28 days from day one of one period to the day before the next. Tracking over several months shows whether your cycles cluster in a narrow range (regular) or vary widely (irregular). One or two off cycles do not define regularity; the pattern over time does.</p>

      <h2>Why Regularity Matters for Estimation</h2>
      <p>Fertility window calculators use your average cycle length to predict when your next period might start, then estimate ovulation by counting backward. When cycles are regular, that prediction is more reliable. When cycle length varies a lot, the next period is harder to predict, so the estimated fertile window has more uncertainty. Regularity does not guarantee exact ovulation timing—ovulation can still shift by a few days—but it makes estimates more useful as a guide.</p>

      <h2>Regular Versus Irregular</h2>
      <p>There is no single cutoff that defines &ldquo;regular&rdquo; for everyone. In general, cycles that usually fall within a range of a few days (e.g. 26–32 days) are often called regular. Cycles that swing widely (e.g. 24 days one month, 40 the next) are often called irregular. If you are unsure, tracking for several months or speaking with a healthcare provider can clarify. This article is informational only and does not diagnose or define medical norms.</p>
