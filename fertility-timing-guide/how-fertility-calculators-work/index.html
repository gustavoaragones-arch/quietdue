      <h1>How Do Fertility Window Calculators Work?</h1>
      <p class="last-reviewed">Last reviewed: February 2026</p>

      <p>Fertility window calculators use the date of your last period and your average cycle length to estimate when your next period might start. They then assume ovulation occurs roughly in the second half of the cycle—often about 14 days before the expected next period—and place the fertile window around that date. They do not measure hormones, track symptoms, or confirm ovulation. The result is an educational estimate based on average patterns, not a personalized medical finding.</p>

      <h2>What You Enter</h2>
      <p>Most tools ask for the first day of your last menstrual period and your usual cycle length. Cycle length is the number of days from day one of one period to the day before the next. If your cycles vary, you may use an average. The calculator does not know your stress level, health, or whether this cycle will follow your average; it only uses the numbers you provide.</p>

      <h2>How the Estimate Is Built</h2>
      <p>The tool adds your cycle length to your last period date to get an expected next period. It then subtracts an assumed number of days (often 14) to estimate ovulation—reflecting the idea that the luteal phase, from ovulation to the next period, is often around two weeks. The fertile window is then shown as several days before that estimated ovulation day plus the day of ovulation. All of this is a formula applied to your inputs; it does not adapt to real-time changes in your body.</p>

      <h2>What Calculators Cannot Do</h2>
      <p>They cannot detect ovulation, measure hormones, or account for stress, illness, or cycle variability. They cannot tell you whether you are fertile on a given day with certainty. They provide a structured estimate for educational use. If you need more precise timing, methods that detect ovulation (e.g. predictor kits, basal body temperature) have their own limitations but can add information. For medical or family-planning decisions, a healthcare provider can offer personalized guidance.</p>

      <p>You can use our <a href="/fertility-window.html">Fertility Window Calculator</a> for a privacy-first estimate based on your average cycle length.</p>
