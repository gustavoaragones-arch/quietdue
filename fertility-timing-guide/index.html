      <h1 id="guide-hero-heading">Understanding Fertility Timing</h1>
      <p class="hero-tagline">Fertility timing refers to the estimation of ovulation and the days in a menstrual cycle when conception is biologically more likely. This guide explains how timing is estimated, what affects variability, and how privacy-first tools calculate fertile windows.</p>
      <p><a href="/fertility-window.html" class="btn btn-secondary">Use the Fertility Window Calculator</a></p>

      <!-- Section 1 — Direct Answer Block -->
      <h2>What Is a Fertility Window?</h2>
      <p>A fertility window refers to the days in a menstrual cycle when conception is biologically more likely. It typically includes the five days before ovulation and the day ovulation occurs. These days are estimated using cycle timing patterns and do not confirm ovulation or predict pregnancy outcomes.</p>

      <!-- Section 2 — How Ovulation Is Estimated -->
      <h2>How Ovulation Is Estimated</h2>
      <p>Ovulation is commonly estimated by counting backward from the expected start of the next menstrual cycle. In many cycles, ovulation occurs roughly midway through the cycle, though timing can vary from month to month. Estimation methods rely on average cycle length and prior period start dates.</p>
      <p>Estimated timing does not confirm the exact day ovulation occurs. Biological processes may shift due to natural variability.</p>

      <!-- Section 3 — Common Misunderstandings -->
      <h2>Common Misunderstandings About Fertility Timing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ovulation always happens on day 14</li>
        <li>Regular cycles guarantee exact timing</li>
        <li>Apps can detect ovulation without biological measurements</li>
        <li>Timing estimates equal pregnancy probability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These assumptions do not hold for everyone. Ovulation timing varies with cycle length and from cycle to cycle. Calculators estimate patterns; they do not measure hormones or confirm ovulation. Fertility window estimates indicate when conception may be more likely, not that pregnancy will occur. Variability and estimation limits apply.</p>

      <!-- Section 4 — Cycle Variability Explained -->
      <h2>Cycle Variability Explained</h2>
      <p>Cycle length can vary due to stress, travel, sleep changes, or routine disruptions. Even individuals with generally consistent cycles may experience natural timing shifts. Timing calculators estimate patterns but do not measure hormones or ovulation directly.</p>

      <!-- Section 5 — How Timing Calculators Work -->
      <h2>How Timing Calculators Work</h2>
      <p>User enters last period start date. User enters average cycle length. Ovulation is estimated using a backward-count method. Fertile window is calculated around that estimate. A visual timing band may illustrate higher-likelihood days.</p>
      <p>These tools provide structured estimates for educational purposes.</p>

      <!-- Section 6 — Privacy -->
      <h2>Privacy and Reproductive Timing Tools</h2>
      <p>Some digital reproductive tracking tools require account creation or store personal cycle history. QuietDue performs all timing calculations directly in your browser. No personal timing data is stored, transmitted, or saved. All inputs remain on your device during use.</p>

      <!-- Section 7 — When to Seek Medical Advice -->
      <h2>When to Seek Medical Advice</h2>
      <p>If menstrual cycles are consistently irregular, significantly changing, unusually painful, or concerning, a licensed healthcare professional can provide personalized medical guidance. This guide and calculator are informational tools and do not replace professional evaluation or diagnosis.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Section -->
      <section class="faq-section" aria-labelledby="guide-faq-heading">
        <h2 id="guide-faq-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl class="faq-list">
          <dt>How accurate are fertility window calculators?</dt>
          <dd>Fertility window calculators estimate ovulation timing based on average cycle length and previous period dates. Accuracy depends on cycle consistency. These tools do not measure hormones or confirm ovulation. They provide structured timing estimates for informational purposes only.</dd>
          <dt>Can ovulation happen earlier or later than expected?</dt>
          <dd>Yes. Ovulation timing can shift from cycle to cycle. Stress, routine changes, and natural biological variation may influence timing. Calculators estimate patterns but cannot confirm the exact day ovulation occurs.</dd>
          <dt>Does stress affect ovulation timing?</dt>
          <dd>Stress and lifestyle changes may influence cycle timing in some individuals. Because of this variability, ovulation estimates are approximate and may differ month to month.</dd>
          <dt>Is QuietDue a medical tool?</dt>
          <dd>No. QuietDue provides informational timing estimates based on user inputs. It does not diagnose conditions, confirm ovulation, or provide medical advice.</dd>
          <dt>Does QuietDue store my data?</dt>
          <dd>No. All calculations are performed locally in your browser. No personal cycle data is stored or transmitted.</dd>
