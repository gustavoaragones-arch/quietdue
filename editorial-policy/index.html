      <h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
      <p>This page describes how QuietDue creates and reviews content. Our standards exist to ensure accuracy, clarity, and respect for people in sensitive situations.</p>

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>QuietDue offers an early pregnancy date calculator and supporting information about pregnancy dating, gestational age, and related topics. All content is informational only. We do not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.</p>

      <h2>Editorial standards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> We describe how due dates are typically estimated and acknowledge when estimates are imprecise. We avoid language that implies certainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity.</strong> We use plain language. We avoid unnecessary medical jargon.</li>
        <li><strong>Tone.</strong> We aim for a calm, empathetic, and non-judgmental tone. Content is written with respect for people who may be in uncertain or difficult situations.</li>
        <li><strong>Boundaries.</strong> We do not make medical claims. We do not use diagnostic language. We do not direct users toward any particular outcome.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Review process</h2>
      <p>Content is reviewed before publication. We check for accuracy, consistency with our standards, and appropriate use of cautious language (e.g. &ldquo;estimated,&rdquo; &ldquo;typically,&rdquo; &ldquo;often&rdquo;).</p>

      <h2>Updates</h2>
      <p>We may update content when needed to reflect changes in our approach or to improve clarity. Significant changes are noted where appropriate.</p>
