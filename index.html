      <h2 id="context-heading">Early pregnancy is uncertain by nature</h2>
      <p class="range-copy">Early pregnancy dates are usually ranges, not exact points.</p>
      <p>Dates shift. Cycle length and ovulation timing vary from person to person. What we call &ldquo;week 6&rdquo; today might be recalculated after more information is available. That&rsquo;s normal.</p>
      <p>Early ultrasounds often change estimates. Measurements in the first trimester can differ from dates based on your last period—and providers may adjust your due date accordingly. It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything went wrong; it just means early pregnancy dating is imprecise.</p>
      <p>Week numbers can feel confusing. Different sources count differently. This tool gives you a best estimate so you can orient yourself—without pretending it&rsquo;s exact.</p>
