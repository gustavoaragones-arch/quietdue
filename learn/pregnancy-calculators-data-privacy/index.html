      <h1>Pregnancy Calculators and Data Privacy Explained</h1>
      <p>Pregnancy calculators are common. So are questions about what happens to the information you enter. This article explains how different tools handle your data and what to look for if privacy matters to you.</p>

      <h2>How many pregnancy tools work</h2>
      <p>Many pregnancy apps and websites ask you to create an account. When you enter your last period or due date, that information is often sent to their servers and stored. It may be used to personalize content, show ads, or support product development. Some tools also use analytics or tracking to understand how people use the site.</p>
      <p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean every tool works this way. But it&rsquo;s worth checking. A privacy policy or about page usually describes what data is collected and how it&rsquo;s used.</p>

      <h2>An alternative: browser-only calculation</h2>
      <p>Some calculators run entirely in your browser. In that model, you enter a date and the calculation happens on your device. No date or result is sent to a server. Nothing is stored in a database. When you close the tab or refresh the page, the information is gone.</p>
      <p>This approach is sometimes called &ldquo;client-side&rdquo; or &ldquo;local&rdquo; processing. It means your data stays with you. The tradeoff is that the tool can&rsquo;t remember your results between visits or sync across devices. For many people, that tradeoff is acceptable.</p>

      <h2>Why privacy might matter</h2>
      <p>Pregnancy can be a private matter. Some people aren&rsquo;t ready to share the news. Others prefer not to create a digital record of sensitive dates. Still others simply want control over their information.</p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re considering a pregnancy calculator, it may help to ask: Does this tool need to store my data to do what I want? If you only need an estimate, a browser-only calculator may be enough.</p>

      <h2>Third-party tools and analytics</h2>
      <p>Even when a site doesn&rsquo;t store your dates, it may use analytics or advertising tools that track your visit. Cookies, pixels, and similar technologies can create a record of which pages you viewed and when. If that matters to you, look for tools that explicitly say they don&rsquo;t use tracking or analytics. A clear privacy policy helps.</p>

      <h2>What to look for</h2>
      <p>When evaluating a pregnancy calculator, consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does it require an account? Account-based tools typically store data.</li>
        <li>Does it have a privacy policy? Read it to see what is collected.</li>
        <li>Does it mention running in the browser or client-side? That often means no server storage.</li>
        <li>Does it use cookies or analytics? Those can create a record of your visit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your choice</h2>
      <p>Different people have different needs. Some want apps that remember their data and sync across devices. Others prefer tools that don&rsquo;t store anything. Both options exist. The important thing is knowing how your chosen tool works so you can decide what&rsquo;s right for you.</p>
