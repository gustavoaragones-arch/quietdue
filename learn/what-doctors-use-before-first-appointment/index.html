      <h1>What Information Doctors Use Before Your First Appointment</h1>
      <p>Before your first prenatal appointment, your healthcare provider has limited information. Here&rsquo;s what they typically use to date your pregnancy and plan your care.</p>

      <h2>The last menstrual period</h2>
      <p>The main piece of information is the first day of your last menstrual period. That date is the standard reference for pregnancy dating. Providers use it to estimate gestational age and due date, using the same 280-day rule that pregnancy calculators use.</p>
      <p>ACOG, the NHS, and the CDC all describe LMP as the primary basis for pregnancy dating before an ultrasound. When you call to schedule your first appointment, you may be asked for this date. It helps the office determine when to schedule your visit and what to expect.</p>

      <h2>Cycle history</h2>
      <p>Providers may also ask about your cycle: how long it typically is, whether it&rsquo;s regular, and whether you use contraception. Regular cycles make LMP-based dating more reliable. Irregular cycles add uncertainty. If you track ovulation, that information can sometimes help refine the estimate, though LMP remains the standard starting point.</p>

      <h2>What providers don&rsquo;t have yet</h2>
      <p>Before your first visit, there is no ultrasound, no physical exam specific to pregnancy, and no lab results from prenatal care. The LMP-based estimate is often the only dating information available. That&rsquo;s why pregnancy calculators can be useful: they use the same logic your provider will use.</p>

      <h2>What happens at the first appointment</h2>
      <p>At your first visit, your provider will typically confirm the LMP and may do an early ultrasound. If the ultrasound date differs from the LMP calculation, they may adjust the due date. Many providers use the ultrasound date when there&rsquo;s a significant discrepancy, especially in the first trimester. They can explain their approach and what your dates mean for your care.</p>

      <h2>If you&rsquo;re not sure about your last period</h2>
      <p>Approximate dates are often used. If you don&rsquo;t remember the exact day, an approximate date is still useful. Your provider can work with that and refine it at your visit. An early ultrasound can help clarify gestational age when the LMP is uncertain.</p>
      <p>If you weren&rsquo;t tracking your period, you might be able to narrow it down using other clues: when you had a positive test, when you last had unprotected sex, or other events that happened around that time. Your provider can help you work through this and will use whatever information is available to get the best estimate possible.</p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>
      <p>Before your first appointment, the main information is the first day of your last menstrual period. Cycle history may add context. An early ultrasound, when done, can provide a more accurate date. Pregnancy calculators use the same LMP-based logic. If you have questions, your provider can explain how they date pregnancy and what to expect.</p>
