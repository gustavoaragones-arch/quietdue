      <h1>Understanding Pregnancy Weeks vs Calendar Dates</h1>
      <p>Pregnancy is usually talked about in weeks&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 12 weeks&rdquo;&mdash;while we often think in months or calendar dates. The two don&rsquo;t line up neatly. Here&rsquo;s why and what it means.</p>

      <h2>Weeks from your last period</h2>
      <p>Pregnancy weeks are counted from the first day of your last menstrual period. So &ldquo;12 weeks pregnant&rdquo; means 12 weeks since that date. It does not mean 12 weeks since conception or since a positive test.</p>
      <p>This convention is used by ACOG, the NHS, the CDC, and most healthcare providers. It creates a consistent reference point, even though the first two weeks of the count happen before conception.</p>

      <h2>Why weeks instead of months</h2>
      <p>Months vary in length. February has 28 or 29 days; July has 31. Saying &ldquo;3 months pregnant&rdquo; is vague. Weeks are more precise. They also match how medical guidelines and research describe development. Providers use weeks to schedule tests, interpret results, and communicate with each other.</p>

      <h2>Weeks and trimesters</h2>
      <p>Trimesters divide pregnancy into three parts. The first trimester is often described as weeks 1–12 or 1–13, the second as weeks 14–27 or so, and the third as the rest. The exact boundaries vary slightly by source, but the idea is the same: pregnancy is divided into phases, and weeks are the unit of measurement.</p>

      <h2>Weeks and due dates</h2>
      <p>A typical due date is 40 weeks from the first day of the last period. That&rsquo;s about 9 calendar months, but not exactly. Forty weeks is 280 days. Nine months could be 273 to 276 days depending on which months. So &ldquo;9 months pregnant&rdquo; is an approximation; weeks are more precise.</p>
      <p>Full-term pregnancy is often defined as 39–40 weeks, though definitions vary slightly. Babies born between 37 and 42 weeks are frequently considered term. These boundaries matter for care decisions, which is another reason providers rely on weeks rather than months.</p>

      <h2>What calculators use</h2>
      <p>Pregnancy calculators work in weeks. You enter the first day of your last period, and they estimate how many weeks and days have passed (your gestational age) and when 40 weeks will be (your estimated due date). They use the same logic as medical practice. The result is an estimate, not a certainty. An early ultrasound may provide a different date.</p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>
      <p>Pregnancy weeks are counted from the last menstrual period. They don&rsquo;t match calendar months exactly. Weeks are the standard because they&rsquo;re precise and widely used. If you have questions about your gestational age or due date, a healthcare provider can help.</p>
