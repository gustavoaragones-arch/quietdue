      <h1>What Does &ldquo;Week 5 Pregnant&rdquo; Actually Mean?</h1>
      <p>When someone says they&rsquo;re &ldquo;5 weeks pregnant,&rdquo; it can be unclear what that number refers to. Is it from conception? From the last period? From a positive test? Here&rsquo;s a plain-language explanation.</p>

      <h2>The standard: weeks from your last period</h2>
      <p>In medical practice, &ldquo;week 5 pregnant&rdquo; almost always means five weeks since the first day of your last menstrual period. It does not mean five weeks since conception or since a positive test.</p>
      <p>This convention is used by ACOG, the NHS, the CDC, and most healthcare providers. Pregnancy is dated from the last period because that date is usually easier to recall than the exact day of ovulation or conception.</p>

      <h2>Why that can feel confusing</h2>
      <p>If you think about it, at &ldquo;week 5,&rdquo; conception likely happened only about three weeks earlier. The first two weeks of the count overlap with the time before conception even occurred. That can seem odd, but it&rsquo;s how the system works.</p>
      <p>When a healthcare provider says you&rsquo;re 5 weeks along, they mean 5 weeks from the start of your last period. When a pregnancy calculator says you&rsquo;re 5 weeks, it means the same thing.</p>

      <h2>Weeks and days</h2>
      <p>You might also see &ldquo;5 weeks, 3 days&rdquo; or similar. That means five full weeks plus three extra days since the first day of your last period. It&rsquo;s a more precise way to express gestational age. Some calculators and providers use it; others round to the nearest week.</p>

      <h2>What typically happens around week 5</h2>
      <p>Around week 5, many people have recently had a positive pregnancy test. Implantation usually occurs in the preceding days or weeks. Some people have early symptoms; others have none. Experiences vary widely, and there&rsquo;s no single &ldquo;normal&rdquo; experience.</p>
      <p>At this stage, development is early. Many people haven&rsquo;t yet had a first prenatal appointment. The LMP-based estimate is often the only dating information available. It&rsquo;s a useful reference, but it&rsquo;s still an estimate.</p>
      <p>This is also a time when many people are waiting for a first appointment. An LMP-based estimate is often the only dating information available until an early ultrasound is done.</p>

      <h2>If your cycle is irregular</h2>
      <p>When cycles are irregular, &ldquo;week 5&rdquo; from the last period may be less accurate. Ovulation might have happened earlier or later than the standard assumption. An early ultrasound can help clarify gestational age. A healthcare provider can explain how your situation affects the dating.</p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>
      <p>&ldquo;Week 5 pregnant&rdquo; means five weeks from the first day of your last menstrual period. It&rsquo;s the standard medical way of dating pregnancy. If you have questions about your gestational age or due date, a healthcare provider can help.</p>
