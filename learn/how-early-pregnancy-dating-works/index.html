      <h1>How Early Pregnancy Dating Works (Before Ultrasound)</h1>
      <p>In the first few weeks of pregnancy, before you&rsquo;ve had an ultrasound, your due date is almost always estimated from one thing: the first day of your last menstrual period. Here&rsquo;s how that works, why it&rsquo;s done that way, and what it means for you.</p>

      <h2>The standard approach</h2>
      <p>Most due dates are calculated using a rule that adds 280 days (40 weeks) to the first day of your last period. This approach has been used for a long time and is still the basis for how many healthcare providers date pregnancy before an ultrasound is done.</p>
      <p>The last menstrual period is used as the starting point because it&rsquo;s usually easier to remember than the exact day of conception. Ovulation doesn&rsquo;t always happen on the same cycle day, and many people don&rsquo;t track it closely. The first day of your period is a clearer reference point.</p>

      <h2>What gestational age means</h2>
      <p>When you hear &ldquo;you&rsquo;re 6 weeks pregnant,&rdquo; that typically means six weeks from the first day of your last period&mdash;not six weeks from conception. In medical terms, pregnancy is dated from the last period, not from fertilization. That can feel counterintuitive, but it&rsquo;s the standard used by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, and many other health bodies.</p>
      <p>This approach goes back a long way. Before ultrasound existed, the last menstrual period was the only practical reference point. Even now, with ultrasound available, LMP remains the starting point for most pregnancies until a scan provides additional information.</p>

      <h2>Why estimates can change</h2>
      <p>Early pregnancy dating is imprecise. Cycle length varies. Ovulation timing varies. If your cycles are irregular, an LMP-based estimate may be less reliable. An early ultrasound often gives a different date, and many providers will adjust the due date based on that scan if it differs from the LMP calculation.</p>
      <p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean the first estimate was &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;&mdash;it means early dating has natural limits. Having a range (often shown as ± several days) can help set realistic expectations.</p>

      <h2>Before your first appointment</h2>
      <p>Before you see a provider, an LMP-based estimate is usually the only information available. Tools like pregnancy calculators use the same logic: you enter the first day of your last period, and they estimate a due date and gestational age. These estimates are for informational purposes. A healthcare provider can confirm or adjust dates based on your situation and any early ultrasound.</p>
      <p>Some calculators also show a confidence window&mdash;a range of dates rather than a single day. That reflects the real uncertainty in early dating. If your provider later gives you a different date, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the calculator was wrong. It means more information became available.</p>

      <h2>In summary</h2>
      <p>Early pregnancy dating before ultrasound relies on the last menstrual period. It&rsquo;s a practical standard, but it&rsquo;s an estimate. Dates may change. That&rsquo;s normal. If you have questions about your dates or your care, a healthcare provider is the right person to ask.</p>
