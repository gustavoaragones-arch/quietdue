      <h1>When Is the First Ultrasound Usually Done?</h1>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re in early pregnancy and wondering when you&rsquo;ll have your first ultrasound, you&rsquo;re not alone. Timing varies by provider and situation. Here&rsquo;s a general overview of when it often happens and what it&rsquo;s typically used for.</p>

      <h2>Typical timing</h2>
      <p>Many providers schedule the first prenatal ultrasound between 7 and 9 weeks of pregnancy. Some do an early scan around 6–8 weeks, especially when there are specific reasons to check dating or confirm the pregnancy. Others wait until later in the first trimester.</p>
      <p>ACOG notes that an early ultrasound can help confirm gestational age and due date when there is uncertainty. The NHS similarly describes first trimester scans as a way to establish dates and check development. Practices differ, so your provider&rsquo;s schedule may not match these general ranges exactly.</p>

      <h2>Why the first scan matters for dating</h2>
      <p>Before an ultrasound, your due date is usually estimated from your last menstrual period. That estimate can be off if your cycles are irregular or ovulation timing varies. An early ultrasound often provides a more accurate gestational age, and many providers will adjust the due date if the scan differs significantly from the LMP calculation.</p>
      <p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean the original estimate was wrong. It means ultrasound adds information that wasn&rsquo;t available before. Having a refined date can help with planning and with interpreting later tests.</p>

      <h2>What the first scan typically shows</h2>
      <p>In early pregnancy, an ultrasound may show the gestational sac, the developing embryo, and sometimes a heartbeat. What is visible depends on how far along you are. At 6–7 weeks, a heartbeat may be detected; earlier than that, it might not be visible yet. Your provider can explain what they see and what it means for your situation.</p>
      <p>Transvaginal ultrasounds are often used in very early pregnancy because they can provide clearer images at that stage. Abdominal ultrasounds are more common later. Your provider will explain the approach they use and why.</p>

      <h2>If you haven&rsquo;t had a scan yet</h2>
      <p>Before your first ultrasound, an LMP-based estimate is often the only dating information you have. Pregnancy calculators use the same logic: they estimate a due date and gestational age from your last period. Those estimates are for informational purposes. Your provider can confirm or adjust them based on your history and any scans.</p>

      <h2>Questions for your provider</h2>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re curious about timing, you can ask your provider when they typically do the first ultrasound and what they use it for. They can also explain how your due date might change after the scan and what to expect at the appointment.</p>
