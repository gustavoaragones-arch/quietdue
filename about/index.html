      <h1>About QuietDue</h1>
      <p>Pregnancy can bring more questions than answers—especially in the earliest days. QuietDue was created for those moments of uncertainty, offering a private and reassuring space to find clarity without judgment or exposure.</p>

      <p>We believe information about your body should belong only to you. That&rsquo;s why QuietDue never collects personal details or creates tracking profiles. Every calculation happens quietly in your browser, leaving no digital footprint behind.</p>

      <p>Our approach is simple: gentle design, accurate guidance, and complete discretion. QuietDue isn&rsquo;t a medical service—it&rsquo;s a quiet tool built with empathy for anyone navigating an early or uncertain pregnancy.</p>

      <p>Here, privacy is protection, and calm is our default. We&rsquo;re here so you can take a breath, find your answers, and move forward—quietly, in your own time.</p>

      <h2>What it does</h2>
      <p>You enter the first day of your last menstrual period. QuietDue estimates a due date, current gestational age, and a confidence window. It also shows early milestones as approximate windows—such as when many people first confirm pregnancy, and when a first ultrasound is often offered. These are ranges, not exact dates. It&rsquo;s normal if things feel unclear. All of this runs entirely in your browser. Nothing is saved, tracked, or sent anywhere.</p>

      <h2>Get in touch</h2>
