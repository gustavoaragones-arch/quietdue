      <h1>Printable Early Pregnancy Timeline</h1>
      <p>A printable timeline can help you keep track of early pregnancy weeks, due date estimates, and key milestones—without apps or accounts. This page explains what a printable early pregnancy timeline is and how to create one privately.</p>

      <h2>What a printable timeline is</h2>
      <p>An early pregnancy timeline is typically a simple document that shows gestational weeks, estimated due date, and sometimes important dates (e.g., when you might expect a first appointment). It&rsquo;s meant to give you a quick reference you can keep offline—on paper or saved locally—without relying on an app or website. Unlike digital trackers that sync to the cloud, a printable timeline exists only where you put it: in a folder, on a bulletin board, or in your wallet. No server stores it. No account is required to create it. You control who sees it.</p>
      <p>Many people want something they can print and tuck away. A timeline that doesn&rsquo;t live in the cloud. One that stays in your control.</p>

      <h2>How to create one</h2>
      <p>The <a href="/">early pregnancy calculator</a> lets you enter your last period and see your estimated due date and gestational week. You can use your browser&rsquo;s print function to create a clean copy of your results. The calculation happens entirely in your browser. Nothing is sent to a server. The same is true if you save the page as a PDF: the file is created on your device and stays there. You decide what to do with it.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the <a href="/fertility-window.html">fertility window tool</a> offers a &ldquo;Generate Printable Summary&rdquo; option. You enter your cycle information, get an estimate, and print a summary that includes your estimated ovulation and fertile window. Again, all processing happens locally.</p>

      <h2>Download your timeline</h2>
      <p>Use the calculator to get your estimates, then print directly from your browser for a private, offline record. You can also use the browser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Save as PDF&rdquo; option if you prefer a digital file on your own device. Either way, no data leaves your machine.</p>
      <p><a href="/" class="link-cta">Generate printable timeline</a></p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>When you generate a printable timeline using QuietDue, no data leaves your device. The calculator runs entirely in your browser. Your dates and results are not saved, stored, or transmitted. What you print stays between you and your printer. There is no account, no cloud backup, and no record of your visit. Closing the tab removes the session.</p>

      <h2>Why a printable timeline is useful</h2>
      <p>A printed timeline gives you a physical reference you can keep in a drawer, bring to an appointment, or share only with people you choose. It doesn&rsquo;t live in the cloud or sync across devices. It doesn&rsquo;t require an app update or an internet connection. For people who prefer to minimize their digital footprint, a paper copy offers control and simplicity.</p>
      <p>Some people like to note appointments, symptoms, or questions directly on the timeline. Others use it as a quiet reminder of where they are in the process. There&rsquo;s no single way to use it. The point is that you have a private record that you control.</p>

      <h2>What to include on your timeline</h2>
      <p>A useful printable timeline typically includes your estimated due window (often shown as a range rather than a single date), your current gestational week, and key milestones such as when a first appointment might be scheduled or when an early ultrasound is often offered. You may also want to note the date of your last period, since that&rsquo;s the reference point most providers use.</p>
      <p>The early pregnancy calculator and fertility window tool both generate summaries you can print. The pregnancy calculator shows gestational age and due window. The fertility tool shows ovulation estimate and fertile window. You can print one or both depending on what you need. If you&rsquo;re early in pregnancy, the pregnancy calculator timeline may be most relevant. If you&rsquo;re also tracking cycles or planning ahead, the fertility summary can complement it. Both tools run locally and store nothing.</p>

      <h2>Printing tips</h2>
      <p>When you&rsquo;re ready to print, use your browser&rsquo;s print function (often Ctrl+P or Cmd+P). You can choose to print to a physical printer or to save as PDF if you prefer a digital copy on your own device. Either way, the data never leaves your machine. If you print at home, the paper is yours. If you save as PDF, the file stays where you put it. No server receives a copy.</p>
      <p>Some browsers offer a &ldquo;Simplify&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minimal&rdquo; print view that strips out navigation and ads. That can produce a cleaner timeline. If you use the fertility window tool, the &ldquo;Generate Printable Summary&rdquo; button prepares a dedicated print view designed to show only the relevant information.</p>

      <h2>When a PDF download might be available</h2>
      <p>This page supports future PDF downloads. A downloadable PDF would let you save a generic or personalized timeline to your device without sending data to a server. For now, the browser print function and the calculator&rsquo;s built-in print views provide the same privacy: everything happens locally. When a PDF option is added, it will follow the same principle—your data stays on your device.</p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>A printable early pregnancy timeline helps you keep track of weeks, due estimates, and milestones without apps or accounts. Use the early pregnancy calculator or fertility window tool to get your estimate, then print from your browser. Nothing is saved or transmitted. The print stays between you and your printer. For maximum control over your information, a locally generated, locally printed timeline offers clarity without a digital record. You can tuck it away, bring it to appointments, or keep it for your own reference—all without creating a cloud-based profile or data trail.</p>
